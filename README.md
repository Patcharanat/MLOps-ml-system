# MLOps - ML System
*patcharanat p.*

## Introduction
Starting an MLOps project is essential for organizations aiming to operationalize or productionize machine learning models to their own business. MLOps bridges the gap between data science and IT operations, ensuring that machine learning models are efficiently deployed, monitored, and maintained in a scalable production environment.

This project aims to introduce the detailed in implementation of machine learning development and deployment process bringing AI to real-world applications over AI development techniques and AI research.
